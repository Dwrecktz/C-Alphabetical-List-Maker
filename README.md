# C# Alphabetical List Maker
This simple console app allows you to import names into the console, and then it will sort the names in alphabetical order.

# How to use:
Downlod VsCode or Visual Studio. Create a new C# Console App Project. Copy and paste the Program.cs file into your project, and then change the namespace to whatever you want.

# Running:
Press F5 on your keyboard (or run), and then it will run the program. Type the number of how many spots (names) you need, and then type or import the names into the console. Then press enter, and it will automatically sort them alphabetically. Additionally, you can build the file to a .exe, so it can be a easy to access file, and you don't need to go into the code editor everytime and hit run for it to work.

# Modification:
To change the color of the text, go to `Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;`, and change Green to the color you want your text to be.
